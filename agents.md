## 3) Technology Needs

### 3.1 Company Website

#### 3.1.1 Main Website (fortegb.com)
Goal: modern, clean institutional site consistent with the brand and positioning.

Required pages/sections:
- **Home**
  - Hero image (user can provide)
  - CTA emphasizing **WhatsApp** contact
- **Portfólio**
  - Houses with pictures, plans, and descriptive info
- **Sobre**
  - Company story, trust/transparency, family business values
- **Blog**
  - Relevant content for prospective customers (AI-assisted content)
- **Contato**
  - Emphasize **WhatsApp + email** (small company, no office)

Content production:
- AI should help generate:
  - Page copy
  - Blog posts (quantity to be defined; user wants help creating many posts)

#### 3.1.2 Self-Guided Tour (Booking + Smart Lock)
From each house listing (portfolio), allow a visitor to book a self-guided tour.

**High-level flow (scheduled booking):**
1. User clicks to book a visit
2. Form collects:
   - Name
   - Mobile number (for WhatsApp)
   - Preferred date/time (calendar selection)
3. Identity verification:
   - Take photo/selfie
   - Upload document (RG or CNH)
   - Use frontend library to compare person photo with document photo
   - Store verification result securely
4. If approved:
   - Create visit entry on a calendar system
   - Generate a unique, time-limited password
   - Use **Tuya API** to write password to the house Smart Lock
   - Send confirmation via WhatsApp (date, time, address, password)
   - Password expires after visit window (e.g., 2-4 hours)

**On-site "instant visit" flow:**
- Customer at the house scans a **QR code** on the sale plaque
- QR opens a website page (house-specific landing page)
- Same verification process (photo + document)
- If approved:
  - Generate password immediately
  - Deliver password via **WhatsApp message** (preferred) or SMS
  - Customer enters immediately
  - Password valid for limited time (e.g., 1-2 hours)

**Technical requirements:**
- Identity verification: use a frontend library to compare a person photo taken and an uploaded document 
- Calendar system: integrate with Google Calendar API or similar
- Password management: secure generation, time-based expiration, audit log
- WhatsApp integration: WhatsApp Business API or Twilio WhatsApp API
- Security: LGPD compliance, data encryption, secure storage of documents
- Smart Lock: Tuya API integration for password management

**Additional considerations:**
- Handle failed verifications gracefully
- Allow manual approval workflow for edge cases
- Track visit history and analytics
- Send reminders before scheduled visits
- Post-visit follow-up automation

> Implementation details will be refined during development phase.

#### 3.1.3 CRM Lead Registration (HubSpot)
Goal: track leads and associate realtor-owned leads to prevent disputes and ensure commissions.

**Requirements:**
- Use a SaaS CRM (likely **HubSpot**)
- Website has a **logged area** for realtors to register leads tied to a house
- If a registered lead buys, realtor gets commission
- Also register leads that come directly to ForteGB
- Data should sync back to HubSpot via API
- Reports/visibility for each realtor and for ForteGB

**Workflow details:**
1. **Realtor registration:**
   - Realtors get login credentials
   - Access to portal showing available houses
   - Can register new leads with:
     - Lead name, contact info (phone, email)
     - Associated house/property
     - Visit date (if applicable)
     - Notes/observations
     - Timestamp for commission tracking

2. **Direct leads:**
   - Website contact forms → HubSpot
   - WhatsApp inquiries → manual or automated entry
   - Self-guided tour bookings → automatic lead creation

3. **Commission protection:**
   - First-registered realtor gets credit (timestamp-based)
   - Lead cannot be reassigned without approval
   - Clear audit trail in HubSpot

4. **HubSpot configuration needs:**
   - Custom properties: house/property ID, realtor ID, visit date
   - Pipeline stages: New Lead → Visit Scheduled → Visit Completed → Negotiating → Closed Won/Lost
   - Automation: notifications to realtors, follow-up reminders
   - Reports: lead source, conversion rates, realtor performance

**Instruction:**
- AI should help:
  - Define the complete workflow and data model
  - Configure HubSpot pipeline/fields/automation/workflows
  - Plan the integration points from the website (API endpoints)
  - Design the realtor portal UI/UX
  - Set up data sync and error handling

---

### 3.2 Social Media (Content Engine)
Need help generating:
- A large set of post ideas (e.g., **100 posts**)
- The actual posts for:
  - Instagram
  - Facebook
  - Optional: TikTok

Content mix:
- House ads (during construction and sales phase)
- Short stories / educational posts about building or buying a house
- Target: prospective home buyers in the Campinas-SP context

Primary goal:
- Accelerate sales while houses are being built
- Drive traffic to the website and convert leads

## 4) How to Work With AI + Project Plan
Expectation:
- AI should parse this file and produce a **phased project plan** to execute:
  - Website creation
  - Tour functionality
  - CRM integration
  - Social content engine

**Decision to make:**
- What should be done inside Cursor/AI vs other tools (e.g., Manus, Lovable, etc.)
- User notes: Manus produced more professional design results than ChatGPT/Gemini in prior experience.
- AI should propose a workflow:
  - Where to design (tool choice)
  - Where to implement (code, content, integrations)
  - How to iterate efficiently with minimal back-and-forth

**Recommended workflow approach:**
1. **Design phase:** Use Manus/Lovable for initial UI/UX design and visual mockups
2. **Implementation phase:** Use Cursor (this tool) for actual code development
3. **Content generation:** Use AI (Cursor) for copywriting, blog posts, social media content
4. **Integration setup:** Use Cursor for API integrations, HubSpot configuration guidance
5. **Iteration:** Design refinements in design tool, code changes in Cursor

**Project phases (to be detailed):**
- Phase 1: Foundation (setup, basic website structure)
- Phase 2: Core features (portfolio, blog, contact)
- Phase 3: Advanced features (self-guided tour, CRM integration)
- Phase 4: Content & marketing (blog posts, social media content)
- Phase 5: Testing, optimization, and launch
